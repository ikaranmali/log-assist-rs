# log-assist

**Async-friendly structured logger for [Seq](https://datalust.co/seq)** that automatically uses your Cargo project name, and safely reports panics (with file & line) even when the runtime is shutting down.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… **Async-friendly** â€” Uses Tokio background task and buffered channel  
- âœ… **Auto app name** â€” Uses `CARGO_PKG_NAME` automatically
